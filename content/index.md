Honestly, I’m not entirely sure what I’m trying to create here with this particular project. What I do know is that I’ve wanted to have a blog for a long time to share ideas, thoughts, and maybe a bit of myself. But for one reason or another, I never started.

Well, that stops today. I can’t keep waiting for the “perfect moment” or the “perfect idea.” Instead, I’m choosing to write simply for the sake of writing. No expectations, no grand plans just a beginning. 

Maybe everything will fall into place eventually. Or maybe it won’t. Either way, here I am. Starting.
